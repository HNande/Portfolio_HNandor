            <p class = "heading"><b>Greetings!</b></p>
            <p>My name is Nándor Hock, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Technology Engineering at 
                 <a href="https://en.via.dk/">VIA University College</a>. 
                 <br>My interest in Software Development stems from my youth, 
                 where I spent a lot of my time using them, largely my grandparents's computer.
                 After a while I got accustomed to the them, before even knowing english(or even what a computer really was) 
                 I scoured the internet finding interesting subjects, and along with it my new obsession.
                </p>
                 <p>Soon after I received my very own computer, 
                  unfortunately it proved to be quite the obstacle to learn programming all by myself, 
                  I didn't exactly know where to start amongst the numerous languages, and tools required to develop.
                  I tried my best nonetheless, and begun my journey with Python. 
                  </p>

            <p class = "heading"><b>Biography</b></p>
            <p>I come from suburban city called Diósd, Located near the capital of Hungary, Budapest. 
            Although I spent most of my time at home, my family is one of the rural variety.
            Meaning I had my fair share of family cookouts, manual unpaid jobs around the house, 
            and plenty of esoteric knowledge from my grandparents that has been passed down to my father, 
            who tries his best to pass it down to me.
        </p>

            <p class = "heading"><b>Interests</b></p>
        <p>Besides software engineering, I am profoundly interested in <a href="https://dnd5e.info/">Dungeons & Dragons</a>, 
            a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which I played both Dungeon Master, and as a Player. 
            In addition to that I am a creative writer and beginner artist for said tabletop game, 
            but so far it was only to pour my ideas not just in writing, but in drawing.
