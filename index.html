            <p>I come from suburban city called Diósd, Located near the capital of Hungary, Budapest. 
            <br>Although I spent most of my time at home, my family is one of the rural variety.
            <br>Meaning I had my fair share of family cookouts, manual unpaid jobs around the house, 
            and plenty of esoteric knowledge from my grandparents that has been passed down to my father, who diligently tried to passed down to me.
