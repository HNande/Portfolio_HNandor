            <p class = "heading"><b>Greetings!</b></p>
            <p>My name is Nándor Hock, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Technology Engineering at 
                 <a href="https://en.via.dk/">VIA University College</a>. 
                 <br>My interest in Software Development stems from my youth, 
                 where I spent a lot time surrounded by all things technological.
                 At first it was only my grandparents computer, where with the guiding hand of my father I learnt the very basics of IT.
                 After a while I got accustomed to them, before even knowing English(or how a computer really worked) 
                 I surfed the internet finding out about interesting subjects, and along with it my obsession that still follows me to this day.
                </p>
                 <p>Soon after I had received my very own computer, 
                  unfortunately it proved to be quite problematic to learn programming all by myself, 
                  I didn't exactly know where to start amongst the wide variety of languages, and tools that are required to develop.
                  I tried my best nonetheless, and during my High School years, I began my journey with Python.

            <p class = "heading"><b>Biography</b></p>
            <p>I come from a suburban city called Diósd, located near the capital of Hungary, Budapest. 
            Although I spent most of my time at home, my family is one of the rural variety.
            Meaning I had my fair share of family cookouts, manual unpaid jobs around the house,
            and plenty of handyman knowledge that has been generously passed down onto me by my elders.
        </p>  
        </div>

            <p class = "heading"><b>Interests</b></p>
        <p>Besides software engineering, I am profoundly interested in <a href="https://dnd5e.info/">Dungeons & Dragons</a>, 
            a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which I played both as Dungeon Master, and as a Player. 
            In addition to that, I am also a creative writer and beginner artist for said tabletop game, 
            although so far it was only to pour my ideas not just into writing, but into drawing as well.
