            <p><b>Greetings!</b></p>
            <p>My name is Nándor Hock, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Technology Engineering at VIA University College, located in Horsens, Denmark.</p>
            <p>My interest in programming stems from my youth, where I spent a lot of my time using the computer,
            <br>it always fascinated me how they work, and how I can create with it.</p>

            <p><b>Biography</b></p>
            <p>I come from suburban city called Diósd, Located near the capital of Hungary, Budapest. 
            <br>Although I spent most of my time at home, my family is one of the rural variety.
            <br>Meaning I had my fair share of family cookouts, manual unpaid jobs around the house, 
            and plenty of esoteric knowledge from my grandparents that has been passed down to my father, who diligently tried to passed down to me.

        <div class="grid-item">
            <p><b>Interests</b></p>
        <p>Besides software engineering, I am profoundly interested in Dungeons & Dragons, 
            a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which I played both Dungeon Master, and as a Player. 
            <br>In addition to that I am a creative writer and beginner artist for said tabletop game, 
             but so far it was only to pour my ideas not just in writing, but in drawing. Which exponentionally improves my storytelling.
