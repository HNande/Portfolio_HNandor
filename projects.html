       Gulf of Mexico, is the perfect programming language I ever worked on, 
       it is special in the way that it only features 4 different types of declarations, 
       the array indexing starts at 1 and not from 0, 
       and amongst the boolean values there is "true", "false", and "maybe".

        A High school project that helped our school manage underage students 
        who wished to exit school grounds during breaks digitally, 
        with only minimal supervision. It was done using a chip reader at the entrance, 
        and dedicated nfc exit cards were handed for the students who are permitted.

        World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer game (MMO), that amongst its many features, has fishing.
        This project was developed to make fishing automatic, intuitive, and require zero attention.
        It listens to in-game audio, looks for sprites and splices it with previous screenshots to find the fishing bobber,
        while also being able to apply hooks, and baits to the fishing pole.
