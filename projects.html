       Gulf of Mexico is the most perfect programming language I have ever worked on. 
       It is special in the way that it only features 4 different types of declarations, 
       the array indexing starts at 1 and not from 0, 
       and amongst the boolean values there is "true", "false", and "maybe".

        This is a high school project that helped our school manage underage students, 
        who wished to exit school grounds during breaks.
        Originally it was done using pen and paper, and later this project served as a digital alternative,
        that required minimal supervision and little to no paper usage.
        It was achieved using a chip reader at the entrance, 
        and dedicated NFC exit cards were handed to the students who were permitted to leave.

        Barotrauma is a survival horror multiplayer game, 
        where you manage the welfare of your incompetent crewmates, all while trying to keep the ship moving, and to keep intruders out.

        World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer game (MMO), that amongst its many features, has fishing.
        This project was developed to make fishing automatic, intuitive, and require zero attention.
        It listens to in-game audio, looks for sprites and splices it with previous screenshots to find the fishing bobber,
        while also being able to apply hooks, and baits to the fishing pole.
